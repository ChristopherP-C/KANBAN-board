# KANBAN-board

  ## Description
  When working in a large team it can be hard to manage tasks left for a project, I want an application to help with that.
  This project is made to aid in task management.
  Using this application users can keep track of personal tasks without affecting team members tasks.
  This project taught me how to properly use JWT tokens and encrypt user password data.
